We all need to pick a day to try and make trend. Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. You said spanking. I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. Uncle Gob… was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale, unless… did you want me to follow you to your car? Quicken! Premiere! How could I say no to the woman who gave me chlamydia? There's unlimited juice? This party is gonna be off the hook. 

Let's see some bananas and nuts! Oh…yeah…the guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! I think the only time you cooked for us was the morning Rosa's mom died. You gave us cereal in an ashtray.  O-kay, who'd like a banger in the mouth? They want to break his legs. It's a good thing he's already got that little scooter. 

Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. And I wouldn't just lie there, if that's what you're thinking.  That's not what I WAS thinking. 

Oh by the way, Doctor said no kissing her on the face for one week. I was like make it two weeks, see if I care! Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot… your wife is dead! No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence. Go ahead, touch the Cornballer. We'll have to find something to do so that people can look at you without wanting to kill themselves. 

Or it could be your colon. I'd want to get in there and find some answers. It's ok. You be with Yam. Why are you squeezing me with your body? It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Yo quiero leche. Yo quiero leche de madre. They don't allow you to have bees in here. Absolutely. And we're going to be here every day. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! 

I've been in the film business for a while but I just can't seem to get one in the can. I've made a huge tiny mistake. And guess what else is back. [slow wink] My breakfast? My friskiness. Mama horny Michael. Annyong. That's how Tony Wonder lost a nut. 

Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? That's a cross. Across from where? After all, why should you go to jail for a crime somebody else noticed? Excuse me while I circumvent you. The old reach-around. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw. I should be in this Poof. Buster, you remember when we were kissing last night? Buster: It was a wild, wild ride. I need a fake passport, preferably to France…I like the way they think. Dead Dove DO NOT EAT. 

I just haven't had sex in a month. You know, you've been here two months. It's hard to gauge time. I hate the Wetlands. They're stupid and wet, and there are bugs everywhere, and I think I maced a crane. Sorry, some of my students are arguing the significance of the shankbone on the seder plate. But we do not - NOT wag our genitals at one another to make a point. 

That coat costs more than your house! I'll sacrifice anything for my children. If that man's straight, then I am sober. 

It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. I want to cry so bad, but I don't think I can spare the moisture. They frame my junk. Can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? Excuse me, do these effectively hide my thunder?
