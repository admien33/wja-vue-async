We need a name. Maybe "Operation Hot Mother." No, let's try to top that. (They never did.) If mother sees this, she will blow a cow. I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with "Fuck Mountain." I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. Happy. Steve Holt? The moron jock? It's a jetpack, Michael. What could possibly go wrong? This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence. 

She's trying to prove that she's closer to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know how little I care for GOB. And I am rock steady. No more dizzies. Dad asked me to do this on the day he pleads not guilty, as a spectacular protest. A…. ? Her lawyers are claiming the seal is worth $250,000. And that's not even including Buster's Swatch. How am I supposed to find someone willing to go into that musty old claptrap? Yes, Annyong. Your name is Annyong! We all know you're Annyong! I don't want no part of yo' tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! 

The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Hey campers! ♪♪ Somewhere… over the rainbow… there's another rainbow… ♪♪ Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. I figured out a way to make money while I'm working! I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. 

I got Michael out of his marriage, didn't I? Actually, she died. ♪♪ Big yellow joint, big yellow joint, I'll meet you down at the big yellow joint. ♪♪ This is not me encouraging you to go here and write a review. No. Everybody dance NOW. 

OH MY GOD, WE'RE HAVING A FIRE… sale. Oh, the burning! ♪♪ Amaaaaaaziiiing Graaaace ♪♪ Suddenly he's too much of a big-shot to brush mother's hair. Steve Holt? The moron jock? I never thought I'd miss a hand so much! So Ann, the question is, do you want a man or a boy? I know how I would answer. 

You're losing blood, aren't you? Probably, my socks are wet. Ah, it is a rock, though. Should beat everything. Gob: There's not a lot of logic to it. And with deep, deep concentration and, and great focus, he's often able to achieve an erect– Why are you squeezing me with your body? Why are you squeezing me with your body? I am going to my spin class. I thought you had vertigo. Quicken! Premiere! Let the great experiment begin! 

Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down. However, she mistook the drowsy eye alcohol warning for a winking eye alcohol suggestion. Absolutely. And we're going to be here every day. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. 

I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! [Stabbing Gob] White power! Gob: I'm white! 

That's so you can videotape it when they put you in a naked pyramid and point to your Charlie Browns. The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON. Yeah, well, have you seen the new Mustang? You could hump that hood. 

See for more good stuff. I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide.
