Am I in two thirds of a hospital room? Heart attack never stopped old big bear. And with deep, deep concentration and, and great focus, he's often able to achieve an erect– 

I just haven't had sex in a month. You know, you've been here two months. It's hard to gauge time. Oh, yes, there absolutely will be a margarita made in my mouth. Fried cheese… with club sauce. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? It's probably wisdom. No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. You're blowing my mind, Frank. Probably out there without a flipper, swimming around in a circle, freaking out his whole family. I've made a huge tiny mistake. 

Chickens don't clap! If you don't start pulling your weight around here its going to be shape up, or…ship up. 

Even it means me taking a chubby… I will suck it up. It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. Yeah, well, have you seen the new Mustang? You could hump that hood. 

What a fun, sexy time for you. Ah coodle doodle doo, ah coodle doodle doo. But I'm the oldest. The matriarch if you will. No. I was ashamed to be _seen_ with you. I like being with you. Dead Dove DO NOT EAT. 

Absolutely. And we're going to be here every day. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down. 

There's a girl in my soup! Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold. I need a fake passport, preferably to France…I like the way they think. Tobias Fünke costume. Well, obviously, I'm not a big guy. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par example. Steve Holt? The moron jock? Come on, this is a Bluth family celebration. It's no place for children. 

Sure, let the little fruit do it. HUZZAH! She wanted to look 48. I nearly airbrushed her into oblivion. Ended up checking "albino" on the form. [climbing under trampoline] This shall keep me safe from the hot Mexican sun. Happy Franklin Friday. Of course. The "Bob Loblaw Law Blog." Wow. You, sir, are a mouthful! They frame my junk. I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run..so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. 

I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this one. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. We need a name. Maybe "Operation Hot Mother." No, let's try to top that. (They never did.) Her lawyers are claiming the seal is worth $250,000. And that's not even including Buster's Swatch. You just grab that brownish area by its points and you don't let go no matter what your mother tells you! This show was cancelled. I mean, COME ON. 

It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette. But anyhoo, can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood?
