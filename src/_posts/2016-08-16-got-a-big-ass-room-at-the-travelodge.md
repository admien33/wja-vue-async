Got a big ass room at the travelodge.  What a fun, sexy time for you. Gosh Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. A-coodle-doodle-doo. A-coodle-doodle-doo. I shall hide behind the couch. (Guy's a pro.) I've been in the film business for a while but I just can't seem to get one in the can. 

You're losing blood, aren't you? Probably, my socks are wet. I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. 

And the soup of the day is bread. Who? i just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of ann. Did you enjoy your lunch, mom? You drank it fast enough. I don't want no part of yo' tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In layman's terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. 

Are you at all concerned about an uprising? If this tableau I recreate, perhaps I can re-snare my mate. And the soup of the day is bread. 

I hear the jury's still out on science. You want to have some guy reach around you in the middle of the night, start messing with your junk? Daddy horny, Michael. The only person that gets Lucille this excited is Gene. Uncle Gob, was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. I made a huge tiny mistake. Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas. But anyhoo, can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? 

♪♪ Big yellow joint, big yellow joint, I'll meet you down at the big yellow joint. ♪♪ I made a huge tiny mistake. 

Also, your knee is on my heart. She wanted to look 48. I nearly airbrushed her into oblivion. Ended up checking "albino" on the form. Yes, she happens to be more experienced than a normal girl, but sometimes love should be… terrifying. If that man's straight, then I am sober. Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. It's OUR nausea. 

This is not me encouraging you to go here and write a review. No. Actually, that was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON. Ohhh little guy. The tears aren't coming. The tears just aren't coming. I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run, so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! Michael: And yet you didn't notice her body? Gob: I like to look in the mirror. 

The CIA should've just Googled for his hideout, evidently. She wanted to look 48. I nearly airbrushed her into oblivion. Ended up checking "albino" on the form. I'M A MONSTER!! Oh…yeah…the guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! 

Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold! Yes. Lindsay and I are planning a night of heterosexual intercourse. I didn't get into this business to please sophomore Tracy Schwartzman, so… onward and upward. On… Why, Tracy?! Why?!! The CIA should've just Googled for his hideout, evidently. Steve Holt? The moron jock? I was hoping he would be gifted sexually.
