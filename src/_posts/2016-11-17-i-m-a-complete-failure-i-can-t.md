I'm a complete failure. I can't even fake the death of a stripper. With spicy club sauce. 

If this were a Lifetime Moment of Truth movie, this would be our act break.  But it wasn't. Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist. The world's first analrapist. Chickens don't clap! It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. Oh, COME ON! 

I hate the Wetlands. They're stupid and wet, and there are bugs everywhere, and I think I maced a crane. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. But anyhoo, can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? It's as Ann as the nose on plain's face. 

No, Pop-pop does not get a treat. I just bought you a f**king pizza. How do you know Steve Holt? Are you in AA? I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. 

Please refrain from Mayoneggs during this salmonella scare. I need a fake passport, preferably to France… I like the way they think. George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt? Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist. The world's first analrapist. I'm sure Egg is a great person. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. 

Make love in your *own* hand, Mother! I cheated and I lied and I whored around. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary and we don't need anymore lawsuits. 

Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale, unless… did you want me to follow you to your car? Can't a guy call his mother pretty without it seeming strange? Amen. And how about that little piece of tail on her? Cute! I may have committed some light treason. Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. 

I am going to my spin class. I thought you had vertigo. It seems like only yesterday you were bursting forth from your mother's fertile womb. 

I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run..so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. Shémale. I'm not a prostitute. Michael: Then I shall let you live! It's ok. You be with Yam. Oh, yes, there absolutely will be a margarita made in my mouth. 

I'll be in the hospital bar. You know there isn't a hospital bar, Mother. Well, this is why people hate hospitals. I've made a huge tiny mistake. I believe you will find the dessert to be both engrossing and high-grossing!  So we don't get dessert? You might enjoy this.  Oh. Em. Gee. That's amazing. Heart attack never stopped old big bear! I've made a huge tiny mistake. Absolutely. And we're going to be here every day. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest.
