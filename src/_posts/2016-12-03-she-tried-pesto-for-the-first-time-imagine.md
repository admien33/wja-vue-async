She tried pesto for the first time. Imagine that, 92 years old and she never tried pesto. What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese? If I look like a man who made love to his wife last night – it's because I almost did. And I wouldn't just lie there, if that's what you're thinking.  That's not what I WAS thinking. I hear the jury's still out on science. It's a wonderful restaurant! I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run..so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. 

Operation Hot Mother. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary, and we don't need anymore lawsuits. I'm going to buy you the single healthiest call girl this town has ever seen. Even though so many people in this office are begging for it. Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down. Of course. The "Bob Loblaw Law Blog." Wow. You, sir, are a mouthful! Dad asked me to do this on the day he pleads not guilty, as a spectacular protest. A…. ? If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. 

I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. Happy. Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. I'd rather be dead in California than alive in Arizona. I've made a huge tiny mistake. But I did finally get into Dad's pants. Although I had to have the crotch taken in a little bit. 

Heyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. A sea of waiters and no one will take a drink order. Yeah, like anyone would want to R her. It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette. Gosh Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. 

Actually, that was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. Her lawyers are claiming the seal is worth $250,000. And that's not even including Buster's Swatch. I should be in this Poof. It's a jetpack, Michael. What could go wrong? How about a turtle? I've always loved those leathery little snappy faces. 

If this were a Lifetime Moment of Truth movie, this would be our act break.  But it wasn't. Oh by the way, Doctor said no kissing her on the face for one week. I was like make it two weeks, see if I care! Are you sure this isn't her sister? Mrs Veal: What a lovely thing to say. Michael: That's an awful thing to say. Ah, it is a rock, though. Should beat everything. Gob: There's not a lot of logic to it. 

Yes, he's like the steel man from The Wizard From Oz. Perhaps an attic shall I seek. This is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken! And don't make the water too hot. The scabs come right off. ♪♪ It ain't easy being white. It ain't easy being brown. ♪♪ Happy Franklin Friday. I guess you can say I'm buy-curious. Bob Loblaw Law Blog. 

Gosh Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. So you take your mom to work every day? Bummer. Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh? It's, like, die already! 

It just seems like there's still light coming in from under the door. We have unlimited juice? This party is going to be off the hook. I'm going to buy you the single healthiest call girl this town has ever seen. It's sort of like going from prime rib to… I don't know… weird brother of prime rib. 

Oh, COME ON! Buster, you remember when we were kissing last night? Buster: It was a wild, wild ride. Ann certainly has a great deal of Mass. I just don't want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. You must teach me the ways of the secular flesh.
