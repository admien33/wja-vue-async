She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. If I look like a man who made love to his wife last night – it's because I almost did. She calls it a mayonegg. Sure, let the little fruit do it. HUZZAH! Michael, you are not quite the ladies man I had pictured. Hopefully, we will remedy that when we are in the spa spreading body chocolate on each other. Bob Loblaw Lobs Law Bomb. I want to cry so bad, but I don't think I can spare the moisture. Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. 

He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. Early. Or it could be your colon. I'd want to get in there and find some answers. It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. I'm gonna go get sexy. He also said some things African American-y wasn't ready to hear. How do you know Steve Holt? Are you in AA? Even though sooooo many people in this office are begging for it. Oh, COME ON! 

Why are you squeezing me with your body? It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. This is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken! For the same reason you should believe a hundred dollar bill is no more than a hundred pennies! Pound is tic-tac-toe, right? This was a big get for God. 

I just don't want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. Friday night. Taste the happy, Michael! Taste it! Look at us, crying like a couple of girls on the last day of camp. 

Dead Dove DO NOT EAT. No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. It wasn't really the pronunciation that bothered me. Chickens don't clap! Whenever she'd change clothes, she'd make me wait on the balcony until zip-up, and yet anything goes at bath time. Everybody dance NOW. Quicken! Premiere! Did Ted make an appointment? No. Well then Ted can GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU GET THE HELL OUT! 

How am I supposed to find someone willing to go into that musty old claptrap? "Circumvent." It means "to go around." Gob: The old "reach around." It's a jetpack, Michael. What could go wrong? She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? It's probably wisdom. I'll sacrifice anything for my children. 

Let me take off my assistant's skirt and put on my Barbra-Streisand-in-The-Prince-of-Tides ass-masking therapist pantsuit. Oh, yes, there absolutely will be a margarita made in my mouth. You are a worse psychiatrist than you are a son-in-law and you will never get work as an actor because you have no talent. What a fun, sexy time for you. I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. A million [bleep]ing diamonds! 

Chickens don't clap! Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. 

Yeah, like I'm going to spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit? Come on! I know she's a brownish area! With points! And I love her! 

Michael, I'm your older brother. I'll never be proud of you. There's a new daddy in town. A discipline daddy. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? So Ann, the question is, do you want a man or a boy? I know how I would answer. I'm a scholar. I enjoy scholarly pursuits. Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit?
