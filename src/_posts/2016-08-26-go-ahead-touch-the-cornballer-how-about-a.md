Go ahead, touch the cornballer. How about a turtle? I've always loved those leathery little snappy faces. Heart attack never stopped old big bear! I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. They're not gonna strip, right? I told them not to, but I can't guarantee their instincts won't kick in. You're Killing Me, Buster. I just don't want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. Let's see some bananas and nuts! 

I thought the two of us could talk man-on-man. Whenever she'd change clothes, she'd make me wait on the balcony until zip-up, and yet anything goes at bath time. There are dozens of us! Dozens! 

I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. Speaking of settling, how's Ann? She's a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen. A-coodle-doodle-doo. A-coodle-doodle-doo. Even though sooooo many people in this office are begging for it. I am getting rid of this thing. It has caused me nothing but pride and self-respect. 

You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. Are you aware of this?  Coming soon. Indeed. But I'm the oldest. The matriarch if you will. Douche chill! 

Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face. 

I'm going to buy you the single healthiest call girl this town has ever seen. Well, they got the Asian right… "hotties" might be a stretch. I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. Fried cheese… with club sauce. And with deep, deep concentration and, and great focus, he's often able to achieve an erect– It seems like only yesterday you were bursting forth from your mother's fertile womb. Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. Let the great experiment begin! 

I should be in this Poof. [climbing under trampoline] This shall keep me safe from the hot Mexican sun. I made a huge tiny mistake. If this were a Lifetime Moment of Truth movie, this would be our act break.  But it wasn't. 

I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run, so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. I mean, it's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars? Everybody dance NOW. Buster, you remember when we were kissing last night? Buster: It was a wild, wild ride. Ah, it is a rock, though. Should beat everything. Gob: There's not a lot of logic to it. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities? You stay on top of her, Buddy. Don't be afraid to ride her. Hard. 

Do you have any idea how often you say the word "afraid"? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi. This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence. 

How am I supposed to find someone willing to go into that musty old claptrap? I was once called the worst audience participant Cirque du Soleil ever had. Up yours, granny! You couldn't handle it! This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. Steve Holt? The moron jock? Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold.
