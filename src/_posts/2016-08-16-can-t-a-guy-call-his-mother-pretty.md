Can't a guy call his mother pretty without it seeming strange? Amen. And how about that little piece of tail on her? Cute! It's a wonderful restaurant! No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. 

Are you at all concerned about an uprising? See for more good stuff. 

Are you aware of this?  Coming soon. Indeed. Oh, yes, there absolutely will be a margarita made in my mouth. There are dozens of us! DOZENS! Oh, yeah, the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in 3 months. Come on! The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. [sniffs hand] Oh, God. I'm going to run this through again on "pots and pans." You might wanna lean away from that fire since you're soaked in alcohol. Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. 

I'm going to buy you the single healthiest call girl this town has ever seen. If this were a Lifetime Moment of Truth movie, this would be our act break.  But it wasn't. You just grab that brownish area by its points and you don't let go no matter what your mother tells you! You just made a fool out of yourself in front of T-Bone. Taste the happy, Michael! Taste it! I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. Gob: You didn't eat that, did you? It's sort of like going from prime rib to… I don't know… weird brother of prime rib. 

No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. A flower in my garden, a mystery in my panties. I am having a love affair with this ice cream sandwich. 

Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. Perhaps an attic shall I seek. It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. I know she's a brownish area! With points! And I love her! Heart attack never stopped old big bear. NO TOUCHING! 

I've been in the film business for a while but I just cant seem to get one in the can. Or it could be your colon. I'd want to get in there and find some answers. I figured out a way to make money while I'm working! 

If I wanted something your thumb touched I'd eat the inside of your ear. I guess you can say I'm buy-curious. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? 

We need a name. Maybe 'Operation Hot Mother'. There are dozens of us! DOZENS! Second-of-ly, I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh I'm sorry, I forgot, your wife is dead. How am I supposed to find someone willing to go into that musty old claptrap? I don't want no part of yo' tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. 

Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass. Say goodbye to THESE! Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror.
