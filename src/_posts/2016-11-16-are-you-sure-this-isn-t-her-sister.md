Are you sure this isn't her sister? Mrs Veal: What a lovely thing to say. Michael: That's an awful thing to say. I will pack your sweet pink mouth with so much ice cream you'll be the envy of every Jerry and Jane on the block! 

This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. Operation Hot Mother. It looks like you've been looking for dragons… in the future. 

Friday night. Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities? George Bush doesn't care about black puppets. 

♪♪ It's The Final Countdown ♪♪ There's unlimited juice? This party is gonna be off the hook. Let me take off my assistant's skirt and put on my Barbra-Streisand-in-The-Prince-of-Tides ass-masking therapist pantsuit. Got a big ass room at the travelodge.  What a fun, sexy time for you. Smack of ham. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? She calls it a mayonegg. 

Talk you off what, Pop Pop? Quicken! Premiere! Dad would stage elaborate situations using a one-armed man to teach us lessons. And that is why Jesus was often referred to as the King of Kings. Queens. The King of Queens. No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. 

Someone order 140 pounds of upper body strength? A trick is something a whore does for money…or candy.  … or cocaine. Probably out there without a flipper, swimming around in a circle, freaking out his whole family. If I make this comeback, I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! 

You're blowing my mind, Frank. Ah, it is a rock, though. Should beat everything. Gob: There's not a lot of logic to it. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? Hair up, glasses off. 

Oh by the way, Doctor said no kissing her on the face for one week. I was like make it two weeks, see if I care! WHY was this show cancelled? I mean, COME ON. Even it means me taking a chubby… I will suck it up. I just haven't had sex in a month. You know, you've been here two months. It's hard to gauge time. Get rid of the Seaward. Lucille: I'll leave when I'm good and ready. Dead Dove DO NOT EAT. You might enjoy this.  Oh. Em. Gee. That's amazing. 

It's one banana Michael, what could it cost, ten dollars? A Colombian cartel that WON'T kidnap and kill you. [climbing under trampoline] This shall keep me safe from the hot Mexican sun. I'm not a prostitute. Then I shall let you live! I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country-club, ya freak bitch! Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. 

It's, like, Hey, you want to go down to the whirlpool? Yeah, I don't have a husband. I call it Swing City. Michael was concerned that he was caught in a lie about his family. The family was concerned that they were being confronted by a woman they had clubbed, drugged, and left on a bench. I call it Tricks –- wait for it – Around The Office. I think the only time you cooked for us was the morning Rosa's mom died. You gave us cereal in an ashtray.
