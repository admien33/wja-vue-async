Annyong. I will pack your sweet pink mouth with so much ice cream you'll be the envy of every Jerry and Jane on the block! The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. Gob: You didn't eat that, did you? What's next, Michael? Are you going to make dancing illegal? Is this the tiny town from Footloose? If this were a Lifetime Moment of Truth movie, this would be our act break.  But it wasn't. She's not 'that Mexican', Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Colombian or something. 

Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. Boy, I sure feel like a Mary without a Peter and a Paul. Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale, unless… did you want me to follow you to your car? 

Turn this skiff around! Or it could be your colon. I'd want to get in there and find some answers. I know she's a brownish area! With points! And I love her! She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom's awesome. You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. Hey, Dad. Look at you. You're a year older…and a year closer to death. Buster: Oh yeah, I guess that's kind of funny. No. I was ashamed to be _seen_ with you. I like being with you. 

Well, I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. I deceived you, mom. Tricked makes it sound like we have a playful relationship. I've been in the film business for a while but I just can't seem to get one in the can. Well, OK, have sex with this girl. Right now. Get in there, have some sex with her. I think the only time you cooked for us was the morning Rosa's mom died. You gave us cereal in an ashtray. Even though so many people in this office are begging for it. When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he's actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman.. I'm not a prostitute. Then I shall let you live! 

Nellie is blowing them all AWAY. Am I in two thirds of a hospital room? Turn this skiff around! ♪♪ It ain't easy being white… ♪♪ Dead Dove DO NOT EAT. I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. 

If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. I know what an erection feels like, Michael. 

Or it could be your colon. I'd want to get in there and find some answers. Touché, Pandora. Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. I made a huge tiny mistake. I'm not a prostitute. Michael: Then I shall let you live! Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite… like my heart is getting hard. 

He also said some things African American-y wasn't ready to hear. Probably out there without a flipper, swimming around in a circle, freaking out his whole family. 

Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good way to think about her, as a backup. I need a fake passport, preferably to France…I like the way they think. If I look like a man who made love to his wife last night – it's because I almost did. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? M: I'll never forget your wedding. I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. I am going to my spin class. I thought you had vertigo. That was Tom Cruise, the actor. They said he was some kind of scientist. 

I'm sure, wherever your father is, she loves you very much. And I wouldn't just lie there, if that's what you're thinking.  That's not what I WAS thinking. I've been in the film business for a while but I just can't seem to get one in the can. Say something that will terrify me. Lindsay: F*** me. Tobias: No, that didn't do it.
