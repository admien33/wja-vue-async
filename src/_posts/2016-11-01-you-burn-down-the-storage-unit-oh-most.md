You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. After all, why should you go to jail for a crime somebody else noticed? And don't make the water too hot. The scabs come right off. And guess what else is back. [slow wink] My breakfast? My friskiness. Mama horny Michael. Monday morning. COME ON! Teamocil. Or it could be your colon. I'd want to get in there and find some answers. 

Well, obviously, I'm not a big guy. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par example. I'll be in the hospital bar. You know there isn't a hospital bar, Mother. Well, this is why people hate hospitals. 

I am having a love affair with this ice cream sandwich. I didn't mean who… I meant… her? Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale, unless… did you want me to follow you to your car? I cheated and I lied and I whored around. But where did the lighter fluid come from? Yeah, like I'm going to spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit? Come on! If I make this comeback, I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! 

I made a huge tiny mistake. Why are you squeezing me with your body? Well, I hope you also carry a spare bowl of candy beans. Shémale. Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne. 

They're not gonna strip, right? I told them not to, but I can't guarantee their instincts won't kick in. O-kay, who'd like a banger in the mouth? Hey, Dad. Look at you. You're a year older…and a year closer to death. Buster: Oh yeah, I guess that's kind of funny. What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese? 

Whenever she'd change clothes, she'd make me wait on the balcony until zip-up, and yet anything goes at bath time. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. Michael: It's just Mom and whores. 

Maybe it was the eleven months he spent in the womb. The doctor said there were claw marks on the walls of her uterus. It's a jetpack, Michael. What could go wrong? Michael, look, this has got to stop. I mean, flattered? Yes. Interested? Not tonight. You need to do more with Rita. Believe me, I'd like to. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw. What's up, fizz-ellas. Everybody dance NOW. 

Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. It's a jetpack, Michael. What could go wrong? Heart attack never stopped old big bear. You're losing blood, aren't you? Gob: Probably, my socks are wet. 

Interfere? I ought to pull down your pants and spank your ass raw. Michael: I'm sorry, have we met? Ann certainly has a great deal of Mass. You're losing blood, aren't you? Probably, my socks are wet. 

I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? Sweet old thing. Only two of those words describe Mom, so I know you're lying to me. I will pack your sweet pink mouth with so much ice cream you'll be the envy of every Jerry and Jane on the block! Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass!
