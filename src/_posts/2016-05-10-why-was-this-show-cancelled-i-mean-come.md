WHY was this show cancelled? I mean, COME ON. We'll have to find something to do so that people can look at you without wanting to kill themselves. With spicy club sauce. Dad would stage elaborate situations using a one-armed man to teach us lessons. Fun and failure both start out the same way. I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run..so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands. 

This is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken! What do you think about Sudden Valley? It sounds like a salad dressing, but for some reason I don't want to eat it. 

A-coodle-doodle-doo. A-coodle-doodle-doo. He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. Early. Quicken! Premiere! A night of heterosexual intercourse. No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. 

Turn this skiff around! If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. [earlier] I don't care for Gob. Gosh Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. If I make this comeback, I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! 

This show was cancelled. I mean, COME ON. Dad would stage elaborate situations using a one-armed man to teach us lessons. What's up, fizz-ellas. First I blow him, then I poke him. What about macaroni – let me finish – salad? The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. A flower in my garden, a mystery in my panties. 

Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. You said spanking. There are dozens of us! Dozens! I just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are! You're losing blood, aren't you? Probably, my socks are wet. I'M A MONSTER!! I hear the jury's still out on science. Teamocil. 

OH MY GOD, WE'RE HAVING A FIRE… sale. Oh, the burning! ♪♪ Amaaaaaaziiiing Graaaace ♪♪ But where did the lighter fluid come from? Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit? ♪♪ It's The Final Countdown ♪♪ Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass. You boys know how to shovel coal? I just haven't had sex in a month. You know, you've been here two months. It's hard to gauge time. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary, and we don't need anymore lawsuits. 

OH MY GOD, WE'RE HAVING A FIRE… sale. Oh, the burning! ♪♪ Amaaaaaaziiiing Graaaace ♪♪ Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. Barry: You said spanking. Let the great experiment begin! Second-of-ly, I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh I'm sorry, I forgot, your wife is dead. It was the first taste of alcohol Buster had since he was nursing. 

Can't a guy call his mother pretty without it seeming strange? Amen. And how about that little piece of tail on her? Cute! I don't want no part of yo' tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! Dad asked me to do this on the day he pleads not guilty, as a spectacular protest. A…. ? No one was making fun of Andy Griffith. I can't emphasize that enough. Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. GENE!! [screams] 

Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant was known for an item on the menu called the "Skip's Scramble", an omelet that contained everything on the menu. Do not order the Skip's Scramble. You might enjoy this.  Oh. Em. Gee. That's amazing. I guess you can say I'm buy-curious. Excuse me while I circumvent you. The old reach-around. Those are balls. It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face.
