I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! You stay on top of her Buddy. Don't be afraid to ride her. Hard. Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. She wanted to look 48. I nearly airbrushed her into oblivion. Ended up checking "albino" on the form. They're not gonna strip, right? I told them not to, but I can't guarantee their instincts won't kick in. No, she's in it. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. Quicken! Premiere! 

I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle. Saw this on the highway and almost blue myself.  Hop on? I was set up. By the Brits. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. She's a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen. Fun and failure both start out the same way. You need to do more with Rita. Believe me, I'd like to. Turn this skiff around! Did you enjoy your lunch, mom? You drank it fast enough. 

Whenever she'd change clothes, she'd make me wait on the balcony until zip-up, and yet anything goes at bath time. The Army had half a day. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. Stack the chafing dishes outside by the mailbox. I'm on the job. 

I made a huge tiny mistake. That was Tom Cruise, the actor. Lucille: They said he was some kind of scientist. And I am rock steady. No more dizzies. 

Taste the happy, Michael! Taste it! Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. You said spanking. I never thought I'd miss a hand so much! 

Let the great experiment begin! There's been a lot of lying in this family. And a lot of love! More lies. What a fun, sexy time for you. I made a huge tiny mistake. Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? That's a cross. Across from where? Mom always taught us to curl up in a ball and remain motionless when confronted. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a… she's the belle of the ball! 

Make love in your *own* hand, Mother! See for more good stuff. Sweet old thing. Only two of those words describe Mom, so I know you're lying to me. Mission Accomplished. 

This is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken! She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? It's probably wisdom. I want to cry so bad, but I don't think I can spare the moisture. I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? I believe you will find the dessert to be both engrossing and high-grossing!  So we don't get dessert? Chickens don't clap! No one was making fun of Andy Griffith. I can't emphasize that enough. 

I need a fake passport, preferably to France… I like the way they think. Excuse me while I circumvent you. The old reach-around. Please refrain from Mayoneggs during this salmonella scare. Ah, it is a rock, though. Should beat everything. Gob: There's not a lot of logic to it. Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. Oh, I don't have any drugs for sale, unless… did you want me to follow you to your car? 

That coat costs more than your house! I'm not a prostitute. Michael: Then I shall let you live! I'm sure Egg is a great person. Oh by the way, Doctor said no kissing her on the face for one week. I was like make it two weeks, see if I care! Waiting for the Emmys. BTW did you know won 6 Emmys and was still canceled early by Fox? COME ON. GENE!! [screams] I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with "Fuck Mountain."
