♪♪ It ain't easy being white… ♪♪ Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than anywhere on the OC? The only person that gets Lucille this excited is Gene. 

Chickens don't clap! Chaw-chee, chaw-chee chaw-chee! Coo coo ca cha! Ah coodle doodle do Caw ca caw, caw ca caw. And I am rock steady. No more dizzies. You just made a fool out of yourself in front of T-Bone. YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw! Oh, hi, Mom. I have the afternoon free. Really? Did "nothing" cancel? You boys know how to shovel coal? Never once touched my per diem. I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup…baby, I got a stew goin'. 

Fried cheese… with club sauce. Fried cheese… with club sauce. 

I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? M: I'll never forget your wedding. She calls it a mayonegg. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a… she's the belle of the ball! The Army had half a day. What do you expect, Mother? I'm half machine! I'm a monster!! Touché, Pandora. Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. 

Sweet old thing. Only two of those words describe Mom, so I know you're lying to me. Get rid of the Seaward. Lucille: I'll leave when I'm good and ready. How about a turtle? I've always loved those leathery little snappy faces. Saw this on the highway and almost blue myself.  Hop on? In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk music band with Lindsay and Maebe which he called Dr. Funke's 100 Percent Natural Good Time Family Band Solution. The group was underwritten by the Natural Food Life Company, a division of Chem-Grow, an Allen Crayne acqusition, which was part of the Squimm Group. Their motto was simple: We keep you alive. I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with "Fuck Mountain." Go ahead, touch the cornballer. Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. 

♪♪ Big yellow joint, big yellow joint, I'll meet you down at the big yellow joint. ♪♪ Bob Loblaw Law Blog. I'd rather be dead in California than alive in Arizona. I think that's one of Mom's little fibs, you know, like I'll sacrifice anything for my children. Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. 

Don't call my escorts whores. Oh by the way, Doctor said no kissing her on the face for one week. I was like make it two weeks, see if I care! Yeah, well, have you seen the new Mustang? You could hump that hood. Although George Michael had only got to second base, he'd gone in head first, like Pete Rose. I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group? I'm not a prostitute. Michael: Then I shall let you live! 

This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence. Look at us, crying like a couple of girls on the last day of camp. Although George Michael had only got to second base, he'd gone in head first, like Pete Rose. 

She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? It's probably wisdom. I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. I'll have a vodka rocks. (Mom, it's breakfast time.) And a piece of toast. Oh, yeah, the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in 3 months. Come on! Everyone's laughing, and riding, and cornholing except Buster. 

The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed. I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle. For the same reason you should believe a hundred dollar bill is no more than a hundred pennies!
