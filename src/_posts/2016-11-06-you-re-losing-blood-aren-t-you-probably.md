You're losing blood, aren't you? Probably, my socks are wet. You want to have some guy reach around you in the middle of the night, start messing with your junk? A lady of the evening. Working girl. She turns illusions for money. Talk you off what, Pop Pop? Fun and failure both start out the same way. 

Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold! And although the intervention didn't work, it turned into one of the Bluth family's better parties. And don't make the water too hot. The scabs come right off. One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with "Fuck Mountain." Well, Michael, I did not find their buffoonery amusing. Well excuse me for liking the way they frame my junk! Oh, hi, Mom. I have the afternoon free. Really? Did "nothing" cancel? 

When a man needs to prove to a woman that he's actually… When a man loves a woman… Ah, it is a rock, though. Should beat everything. Gob: There's not a lot of logic to it. It's so watery. And yet there's a smack of ham to it. I've been in the film business for a while but I just can't seem to get one in the can. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! Michael: And yet you didn't notice her body? Gob: I like to look in the mirror. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. If I wanted something your thumb touched, I'd eat the inside of your ear. 

You can control your bladder when you're dead! It walked on my pillow! You're Killing Me, Buster. The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Heyyyyy campers!  You're Killing Me, Buster. It's sort of like going from prime rib to… I don't know… weird brother of prime rib. 

Probably out there without a flipper, swimming around in a circle, freaking out his whole family. Operation Hot Mother. Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce. What a fun, sexy time for you. Heyyyyy, hermano. 

Well, I hope you also carry a spare bowl of candy beans. You boys know how to shovel coal? You're a good guy, mon frere. That means brother in French. I don't know how I know that. I took four years of Spanish. 

GENE!! [screams] Dad asked me to do this on the day he pleads not guilty, as a spectacular protest. A…. ? I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle. Butterscotch! Want a lick? In prison, you just have to close your eyes and take it, but here you have to close your eyes and give it. 

If you don't start pulling your weight around here its going to be shape up, or…ship up. Ann, you need to decide whether you want a man or a boy. I know how I'd answer. She calls it a mayonegg. 

I never thought I'd miss a hand so much! We have unlimited juice? This party is going to be off the hook. Michael, you are not quite the ladies man I had pictured. Hopefully, we will remedy that when we are in the spa spreading body chocolate on each other. 

Heart attack never stopped old big bear. Yeah, I invited her. You said you wanted to spend time some with her. You said I was being an Ann hog. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. Heart attack never stopped old big bear. And I wouldn't just lie there, if that's what you're thinking.  That's not what I WAS thinking.
