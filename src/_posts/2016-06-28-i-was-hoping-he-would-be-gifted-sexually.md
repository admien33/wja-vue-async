I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! Today I learned this is a real place, tho more lush than the OC. Gosh Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? 

I've made a huge tiny mistake. O-kay, who'd like a banger in the mouth? I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. 

I'm tired of trying to find happiness through lies and self-medicating. If you need me, I'll be at the bar. So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me! I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. A night of heterosexual intercourse. I just don't want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. I didn't mean who… I meant… her? 

And guess what else is back. [slow wink] My breakfast? My friskiness. Mama horny Michael. Speaking of settling, how's Ann? Shémale. I am having a love affair with this ice cream sandwich. 

Second-of-ly, I know you're the big marriage expert. Oh I'm sorry, I forgot, your wife is dead. Did Ted make an appointment? No. Well, then Ted can GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU GET THE HELL OUT! In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk music band with Lindsay and Maebe which he called Dr. Funke's 100 Percent Natural Good Time Family Band Solution. The group was underwritten by the Natural Food Life Company, a division of Chem-Grow, an Allen Crayne acqusition, which was part of the Squimm Group. Their motto was simple: We keep you alive. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. I cheated and I lied and I whored around. 

And with deep, deep concentration and, and great focus, he's often able to achieve an erect– Oh by the way, Doctor said no kissing her on the face for one week. I was like make it two weeks, see if I care! She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. Family Love Michael. 

Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass. Why are you squeezing me with your body? It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Please refrain from discussing or engaging in any sort of interoffice [bleep] or [bleep] or finger[bleep] or [bleep]sting or [bleep] or even [bleep]. Excuse me, do these effectively hide my thunder? 

The Army had half a day. A sea of waiters and no one will take a drink order. Go ahead, touch the cornballer. It's as Ann as the nose on plain's face. 

I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. It's a gaming ship. Turn this skiff around! Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. I just haven't had sex in a month. You know, you've been here two months. It's hard to gauge time. I know what an erection feels like, Michael. I was once called the worst audience participant Cirque du Soleil ever had. 

There are dozens of us! DOZENS! I should be in this Poof. Yes, she happens to be more experienced than a normal girl, but sometimes love should be… terrifying. With spicy club sauce. Yes, she happens to be more experienced than a normal girl, but sometimes love should be… terrifying. NO TOUCHING! It was the first taste of alcohol Buster had since he was nursing.
