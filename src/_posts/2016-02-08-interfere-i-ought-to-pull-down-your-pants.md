Interfere? I ought to pull down your pants and spank your ass raw. Michael: I'm sorry, have we met? I figured out a way to make money while I'm working! I think the only time you cooked for us was the morning Rosa's mom died. You gave us cereal in an ashtray. Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass. It's ok. You be with Yam. Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist. The world's first analrapist. One for the ladies. Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. 

Michael, look, this has got to stop. I mean, flattered? Yes. Interested? Not tonight. Today I learned this is a real place, tho more lush than the OC. No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being WITH you. 

Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Hey, look at that – you're mean sober, too. 

If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. [earlier] I don't care for Gob. She's trying to prove that she's closer to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know how little I care for GOB. For the same reason you should believe a hundred dollar bill is no more than a hundred pennies! If I make this comeback, I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! I'm sure, wherever your father is, she loves you very much. Excuse me, do these effectively hide my thunder? I'm not a prostitute. Michael: Then I shall let you live! It's so watery. And yet there's a smack of ham to it. 

I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this one. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. Annhog's coming? 

That was Tom Cruise, the actor. They said he was some kind of scientist. I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this one. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. 

Of course. The "Bob Loblaw Law Blog." Wow. You, sir, are a mouthful! She calls it a mayonegg. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? It's probably wisdom. I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? 

Heart attack never stopped old Big Bear. I didn't even know we were calling him Big Bear. We never had the chance to. Oh, COME ON! Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant was known for an item on the menu called the "Skip's Scramble", an omelet that contained everything on the menu. Do not order the Skip's Scramble. Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. Yes. Lindsay and I are planning a night of heterosexual intercourse. We have unlimited juice? This party is going to be off the hook. Yes, Annyong. Your name is Annyong! We all know you're Annyong! 

I think I might have someone who's going to circumvrent the law. This was a big get for God. The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Heyyyyy campers! This show was cancelled. I mean, COME ON. If I make this comeback, I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! Friday night. Please refrain from discussing or engaging in any sort of interoffice [bleep] or [bleep] or finger[bleep] or [bleep]sting or [bleep] or even [bleep]. 

She's a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen. My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done, but I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done" for an answer. Excuse me while I circumvent you. The old reach-around. I'm tired of trying to find happiness through lies and self-medicating. If you need me, I'll be at the bar. Nellie is blowing them all AWAY. ♪♪ It's The Final Countdown ♪♪ I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. It's a gaming ship.
