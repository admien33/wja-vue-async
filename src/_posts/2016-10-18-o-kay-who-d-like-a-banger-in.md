O-kay, who'd like a banger in the mouth? You want your belt to buckle, not your chair. I'm in Vegas this week and would like to point out the Blue Man Group is *actually* hiring. The support group? Dead Dove DO NOT EAT. I've made a huge tiny mistake. 

Let me out that Queen. Family Love Michael. 

I hate the Wetlands. They're stupid and wet, and there are bugs everywhere, and I think I maced a crane. Well, obviously, I'm not a big guy. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par example. Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. You said spanking. I'd rather be dead in California than alive in Arizona. Now, do you wanna steer, or are you too old to sit on your Pop's lap and drive? ¡Soy loco por los Cornballs! Oh, hi, Mom. I have the afternoon free. Really? Did "nothing" cancel? 

Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. Michael: It's just Mom and whores. I'm sure Egg is a great person. She's a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? Friday night. I was set up. By the Brits. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. 

I hear the jury's still out on science. With spicy club sauce. That's so you can videotape it when they put you in a naked pyramid and point to your Charlie Browns. Buster, you remember when we were kissing last night? Buster: It was a wild, wild ride. 

What's next, Michael? Are you going to make dancing illegal? Is this the tiny town from Footloose? Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. Dead Dove DO NOT EAT. If mother sees this, she will blow a cow. God knows they're squinters. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Probably out there without a flipper, swimming around in a circle, freaking out his whole family. Pound is tic-tac-toe, right? 

When a man needs to prove to a woman that he's actually… When a man loves a woman… What's gotten into you? Have you been eating cheese?  Hahahahah! ♪♪ It ain't easy being white. It ain't easy being brown. ♪♪ I'd rather be dead in California than alive in Arizona. When a man needs to prove to a woman that he's actually… When a man loves a woman… I hear the jury's still out on science. Let's see some bananas and nuts! Heyyyyyy, Uncle Father Oscar. 

Yeah, that's a cultural problem is what it is. You know, your average American male is in a perpetual state of adolescence, you know, arrested development. (Hey. That's the name of the show!) I just don't want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. I am having a love affair with this ice cream sandwich. If you didn't have adult onset diabetes, I wouldn't mind giving you a little sugar. I was set up. By the Brits. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. Heyyyy uncle father Oscar. 

Michael, I'm your older brother. I'll never be proud of you. You need to do more with Rita. Believe me, I'd like to. I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! Yes. Lindsay and I are planning a night of heterosexual intercourse. Each year, Oscar attempts the four hundred mile walk from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California. In the twelve years that he's attempted this, he's never made it farther than UC Irvine. And here you are coming out of your mother's third base! Ohhh little guy. The tears aren't coming. The tears just aren't coming. It's sort of like going from prime rib to… I don't know… weird brother of prime rib. 

Teamocil. I am going to my spin class. I thought you had vertigo. Today I learned this is a real place, tho more lush than the OC. I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run, so now I'm afraid I have something of a mess on my hands.
